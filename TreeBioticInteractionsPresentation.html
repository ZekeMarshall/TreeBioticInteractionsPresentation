## Aim

* Identify what organisms are associated with a range of native and non-native trees

* Investigate whether the number of organisms associated with each tree is
correlated to the length of time that species has been present in Britain.

* Identify under-studied tree species.

* Identify obligate organisms.

## Relevance

* Analysing species occurrences doesn't explicitly tell us why a species is present in a habitat.

* Help assess the biodiversity value of native vs non-native trees &amp; woodlands.

* Analysing species interactions may help us to predict the species which can be supported in 
heavily modified, human-dominated ecosystems.

## Limitations

* FRDBI data has information on the substrate that the interaction was recorded
on, but only for some observations

* BLS data has no information on the nature of the interactions, though for 
Lichens the relationship is usually commensal, with Lichens as Epiphytes.

* DBIF data by nature records trophic interactions wherein the host tree is the 
food source of the insect

* Mitchell studies have notes for some species, but no structured classification
of interaction types.

* No information on the abundance or biomass of a given organism associated
with each tree.

* Limited information on the location (and therefore habitat and conditions) that
the interaction was recorded in.
